/*

! CORS -> Cross-Orign Resource Sharing
!   -Uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web app running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin

? access-control-allow-orgin -> tells the browser to allow code from any origin

? access-control-allow-methods -> specifies the methods allowed when accessing the resource in response to a "pre-flight" request

? access-control-allow=headers -> used in response to a preflight request that indicates which HTTP headers can be used during an actual request

* Preflight Request -> checks to see if the CORS protocol is understood.
*   - ex: a client might be asking a server if it would allow a DELETE request before actually sending that DELETE request
